# Catalyst Voting Process Research using Zero-Knowledge Proofs

## Introduction

This repository contains the research and deliverables of **Duke Peter** on integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) within blockchain ecosystems, specifically focused on enhancing transparency and security in the **Catalyst Voting Process**. The research aims to explore how ZKPs can offer a cryptographically secure method for validating votes without revealing the individualâ€™s identity, addressing key challenges in decentralized voting systems.

## Context

The **Catalyst Voting Process** is a critical part of the **Cardano blockchain ecosystem**, enabling community members to vote on proposals that influence the direction of its development. However, maintaining transparency while preserving voter privacy has been an ongoing challenge. This research explores how Zero-Knowledge Proofs can mitigate privacy concerns while ensuring the integrity of the voting process.

Duke Peter conducted this research to:
- Investigate the feasibility of implementing ZKPs in voting mechanisms.
- Explore real-world applications of ZKPs in decentralized governance.
- Recommend strategies for enhancing privacy and security in blockchain-based voting systems.
